- BAG reports # fully vaccinated people & # administered doses.
- number of partially vaccinated people is calculated as  `nDosesAdmin - nFullyVacc * 2`.
- drop in reported fully vaccinated people in NW on 2021-03-16 is in the data. No idea what happened there.
- data by age group is only reported for 19/26 cantons (accounting for about 50% of CH by Population) and therefore not plotted. While there is data for CH and CH & FL in the data files from the BAG these data are incomplete.
