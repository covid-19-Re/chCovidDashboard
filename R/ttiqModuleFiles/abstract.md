We present a mathematical model that leverages empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) strategies can reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The TTIQ strategy is determined by five independent parameters:

1.	f : Probability that a symptomatic individual is isolated from the population;
2.	Δ<sub>1</sub> : Time delay between symptom onset and isolation;
3.	τ : Duration prior to symptom onset in which contacts are identifiable;
4.	g : Fraction of identifiable contacts that are successfully traced and quarantined per isolated index case;
5.	Δ<sub>2</sub> : Time delay between isolation of the index case and the start of quarantine for the secondary contacts.

We have two further parameters describing the epidemic situation *without* TTIQ measures:

1.  R : the expected number of infections caused by a single infected;
2.  α : the fraction of transmission that is attributable to asymptomatic cases.
