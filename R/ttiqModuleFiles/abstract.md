We present a mathematical model that leverages empirically determined distributions of incubation period, infectivity, and generation time to quantify how test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) strategies can reduce the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The TTIQ strategy is determined by five independent parameters:

1.	f : the fraction of infected individuals who test positive and are isolated from the community;
2.	Δ<sub>1</sub> : the delay between symptom onset of an infected individual and the time they are isolated from the community;
3.	τ : the duration of time for which close contacts are traced prior to symptom onset;
4.	g : the fraction of close contacts per index case that are successfully traced and quarantined;
5.	Δ<sub>2</sub> : the delay between isolating the index case and quarantining the secondary cases.
